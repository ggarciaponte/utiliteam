Declare single class and related functions/types (e.g. comparators and helper functions) in their hpp file.
Make a cpp/cxx file for each hpp file where you define every declared type.
Make a testing cpp for each of those hpp files.

Workflow:
1. write a test (start with easiest, smallest thing possible)
2. write code that makes the test pass
3. refactor <-- don't skip this

Pro tips:
* Use good naming by picking good conventions
* DRY (Don't repeat yourself). If you copy and paste you will 100% guaranteed regret it.
* Write documentation first
* Short functions (~10 lines max)
* Imagine you have to show your code to a new incoming student
* Encapsulate tests in functions/classes as needed
